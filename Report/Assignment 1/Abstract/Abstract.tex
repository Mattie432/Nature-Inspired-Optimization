    \section{Introduction}
		This assignment aims to assess how you implement and experimentally compare different nature-inspired
algorithms. It aims at giving you some first hands-on experience of applying a nature-inspired
algorithm in a given context and drawing conclusions about some operators from a set
of experimental results. We consider different mutation operators in the context of continuous
function optimisation.
